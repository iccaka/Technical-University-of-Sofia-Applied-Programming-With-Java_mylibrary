# Technical-University-of-Sofia-mylibrary

*A remake of my original website([MyLibrary](https://github.com/iccaka/MyLibrary)) which used HTML/CSS/JS+JQuery for front end and FireBase as a database. This time, the purpose of creating this website, is for us to learn how to use Spring and get comfortable with the whole architecture(database(relational, Postgres) -> JDBC -> ORM(Hibernate) -> API)*

## Built With

* [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - *The IDE used*

## Authors
